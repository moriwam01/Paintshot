						<p>I ordered this portrait as a Christmas gift and was absolutely delighted with how it turned out. Our much loved dog was killed in November and this is a wonderful tribute to her. The artist has captured her brilliantly and we are both so happy with it. It now has pride of place on our living room wall and we will certainly recommend you to our friends. We also intend getting another portrait done once we�ve looked out the photographs. Thank you once again for this amazing picture. The whole service from start to finish was very easy and your staff were always helpful. Please pass our special thanks to the artist for doing such an amazing job. Kind regards Lesley</p>

						<p>I was looking for a special gift that my girlfriend would really appreciate.  She loves our cat so I brainstormed about how I could get her a great gift that related to our cat.  After I decided on a painting, I did some research and came across www.paintmyphotonow.com.  I was quite impressed to say the least.  The paintings on this site were more realistic then I could ever imagine a painting to be.  I contacted Paint My Photo Now directly to inquire about the process and the customer service I experienced was top notch.  I quickly placed an order and within 2 weeks was sent a preview of the painting.  If I was not aware that it was a painting, I would've thought that it was a picture; the painting was that realistic.  I was so thrilled with the painting and customer service that I already placed another order, and plan to place several more.</p>

						<p>I purchased a painting from paintmyphotonow.com and was immediately impressed by the quality of the painting  That being said, I immediately ordered a second painting.  The first painting was of my cat and the second was of two cyclists.  Even though the pictures had very different subjects, paintmyphotonow.com did a great job on both paintings.  The painting was painted quickly, shipped in superb packaging in a timely manner. I am very happy, and have already ordered a third painting from paintmyphotonow.com.</p>

						<p>I wanted to thank the artist that painted the picture of my dog. They did a wonderful job. The level of detail was exquisite. I could not have asked for anything more. As a matter fact, I ordered a second painting of my sister's dog for Christmas. I can't wait to see her face when she receives this painting. Again, thank you so much.</p>
