                  We could not believe how very beautiful the portrait is that
                  you created for us. My mom passed away a year ago and my dad
                  had mentioned wanting a portrait of mom someday. We did not
                  know where to get it done and found your website through
                  browsing the internet for ideas. I am so glad we did. Your
                  artist captured the image of my mom perfectly. Her eyes hold
                  the same loving warmth in this portrait as she did while with
                  us. Thank you so much for your professionalism and overall
                  wonderful experience. We will definately be returning for
                  future portraits. Thank you!

                  We received the painting today and were quite pleased with it.
                  The frame is also nice. We will be giving this to my parents
                  for their 40th anniversary on Monday, so thank you for your
                  timely shipping of the painting. I appreciate the fact that
                  your company sends the buyer proofs of the photo that is
                  altered and of the painting as the process continues. I think
                  the final product turned out beautifully.

                  I wanted to thank the artist that painted the picture of my
                  dog. They did a wonderful job. The level of detail was
                  exquisite. I could not have asked for anything more. As a
                  matter fact, I ordered a second painting of my sister's dog
                  for Christmas. I can't wait to see her face when she receives
                  this painting. Again, thank you so much.

                  I did indeed receive my painting and I am thrilled with the
                  final product. It was done very quickly, much sooner than I
                  anticipated. This is going to be a gift for good friends who
                  just sold the house they lived in for 37 years, so I can only
                  imagine their faces when I present them with this wonderful
                  memory. Thanks for a great job and I will totally recommend
                  you to friends and family.

                  I gave the painting to my girlfriend over the weekend and she
                  loved it. She said it was the best Christmas present she had
                  ever received! Thank you for all of the hard work that went
                  into the painting.

                  It looks like you did a wonderful job. Especially since you
                  had to remove people in the foreground and didn't know what
                  was behind them. Can't wait to see it in person. Thank you!

                  I did receive the photo and I am extremely happy with it. You
                  did a terrific job for which I can't thank you enough. I will
                  certainly recommend you to others as I'm sure that once my
                  family and friends see the painting, they will ask where I had
                  it done. Thank you again.

                  Amazing work at its best, high quality painting at a very low
                  cost. I have a love for white tigers and cougars and found
                  this picture and submitted it to get painted and when I
                  received my pictured frame I was totally blown away about how
                  much detailed went into it. Thank you guys so so much!!

                  Hello, I just loved how helpful and informed I was with the
                  whole process of my painting. Your website is very easy to
                  understand and made it very clear on the steps that followed.
                  Your team of artist are amazing, and I'm very happy with the
                  editing as well as the proof of the portrait. Your company did
                  outstanding in keeping to the timeline without missing
                  quality. I will highly return for more paintings to be done as
                  well as strongly recommend my friends and family to do the
                  same. Thank you for making this an pleasurable experience.

                  We just received our painting in the mail a few days ago. It
                  is absolutely beautiful and the artist is very talented. The
                  artist worked so hard with us to get the painting just as we
                  wanted it. We really love it and it is hanging in our house
                  already. Thank you very much for everything. Planning to order
                  more paintings in the future.

                  The portrait is beautiful! Everyone looks true to life, and
                  the painting actually improves on some of the flaws of the
                  original photo (ie pale skin tone, busy background). The

                  These people are wonderful to deal with. They will work very
                  hard to give you the exact final product that you want. This
                  painting of me is an anniversary present for my husband. It
                  came out exactly as we\'d hoped. He loves it. My thanks go to
                  all the people at Paint My Photo now. If you have a photo you
                  want made into a painting these people will not disappoint
                  you.

                  Just opened my painting (Kayaking in New York harbor) and was
                  pleasantly surprised. Looking at the draft on a computer
                  screen did not do the finished product justice. The value for
                  the price is outstanding. Thanks

                  Painting looks wonderful. Thank you for all your efforts to

                  This is the fourth time I have used Paint My Photo Now to do
                  an oil painting from one of my photos. I can not recommend
                  these people enough. They are prompt, courteous, and totally
                  responsive to my requests as to the final painting. They
                  always work with me till I am totally satisfied. Actually they
                  are so wonderful to deal with that it makes me want to get
                  more and more photos done in oils from them. I tell all my
                  family and friends about them because I know these people will
                  not disappointment them. I simply can't say enough good about
                  Paint My Photo Now.

                  Looking at these photos was a bit like finppilg through the
                  pages of an old family album of a long ago era. We know these
                  people, but the effect you employed created a sense that they
                  were captured in a different place and time. As we have yet to
                  see our Kai(just two more months!), every new image of him is
                  a gift. Thank you.

                  Yes we have received the painting and are very satisfied. One
