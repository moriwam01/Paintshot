						<h4 class="howtitle">Vilma Marku, Pennsylvania</h4>
						<p>I have had a wonderful experience working with paintmyphotonow throughout the entire process, from start to finish. The customer service has been incredible. Responses were quick and addressed all my questions and concerns. In addition, I received frequent updates on my painting. The artist\'s work was incredible. From a not-well-lit photo, the artist was able to perfectly capture everything. The artist did an amazing job to begin with, but then went above and beyond by listening to my suggestions/comments and editing their work to fit my vision. I was truly impressed by the fact that nothing I asked for was a problem for the artist and that everyone was so accommodating. The artist also did an amazing job with the background, especially the black border, the bars, getting rid of the people, and the wallpaper of the restaurant of the photo. In fact I had never noticed that the restaurant had two different wallpaper in the background until I saw the painting and then looked closer to the original photo. Just an example that the artist\'s work was so excellent that even the smallest details were captured, details that looking at the photo I was unaware of myself. I have shown the painting to family and coworkers and they have all been amazed. I am very happy with my purchase and have recommended your business already to others.</p>

						<p>Had this completed for my mom's Christmas present this year. The whole family absolutely loved it. I can't remember a present having this kind of response. So beautiful and arrived so quickly. Such attention made to detail. As nice as it is in the picture, it is so much better in person. </p>

						<p>I ordered an oil of our 4 year old Golden,Billy,for my husbands 40th anniversary-birthday present. First,the folks here at just the best for customer service and quick resonsiveness. Just a pleasure to work with. The quality of our portrait is stunning and my husband , as well as everyone that sees it is just amazed in the beauty and the depth of the portrait. And i think it also needs to be daid a vrat value. It will forever be a treasure and we will always have our buddy in oil today as well as the gorgeous memory of our greatest pal long after he passes over that Golden bridge thank you !!</p>

						<p>We presented the painting to the father of the boy that was painted.  His son was in a tragic accident and passed away.  When we gave the painting to him, he absolutely loved it.  The artist did a fantastic job.  Thank you very much for your quick turnaround.  I will be ordering again very soon.</p>
